## General instructions (you can ignore these if you are doing SQL Evaluations only)

The version of python to be used for this assignment is the default version that ships with Ubuntu at time of writing (3.8). 

Typing hints must be used and mypy will be used to test them. It is advisable to write tests for the features you develop. I will write tests for your code in any case, but you might find it helpful to write your own to make sure your code is working as expected. 

Docstrings should be present on classes and functions. The main program should ultimately be in python but if you want to use C or C++ to write parts of this code and call it from python using python's subprocess module or using tools like pybind11, you can but 50% of the code you have written must be python. 

Fork this git repository and submit the link of the git repo where you have shown your solutions to the evaluations below. 

Each solution must include its own requirements.txt file in case you use any external libraries. The only external libraries you should have to use is Flask (or FastAPI) for Evaluation 1, mypy for checking type annotations and Pytest is a good option for a testing suite if you like to use it (you don't have to).
